              <h3><strong>Inspiration:</strong></h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Mr. Mike Smith was motivated by the challenges he saw in local schools — overcrowded classrooms, lack of structured discipline, and limited focus on holistic development.
                </li>
                <li>His vision was to create a school that not only teaches but also shapes character,  where every child could thrive academically while learning values of responsibility and leadership.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>Mrs. Diana Smith was driven by her experiences with young learners, noticing how early childhood education often lacked personal attention and nurturing environments.</li>
                <li>Her dream was to establish a school where children feel safe, loved, and confident from their very first day and also ensure that the lower primary department remains a place of joy, curiosity, and growth.</li>
