      <p> 
        Founders of Shine Mission School: Mr. Mike Smith and Mrs. Diana Smith.<br> The school began in 2016 when Mr. Mike and his wife decided to create a place that focused on strong learning and discipline. They started with a small class. They added more teachers as enrollment grew. Their goal was to give every child the chance to learn with confidence. They worked together to build a system that supports students. They kept the school open to new ideas. They improved the teaching methods every year. Their leadership shaped the culture of the school and set the standards that students follow today. The school now serves many families. It continues to grow because of the founders’ early commitment to quality and consistency. Their work still guides the direction of the school.</p>

  <h2>Lighting the Fire of Learning</h2>
  <p>
    In halls where voices rise and sing,<br>
    The seeds of knowledge take their wing.<br>
    Each student’s step, a path begun,<br>
    Toward brighter skies, toward rising sun.<br><br>

    Education is the noble flame,<br>
    It shapes the heart, it carves the name.<br>
    No crown of gold, no jewel of stone,<br>
    Can match the wisdom we have grown.
